A serial exception error occurred: Cannot configure port, something went wrong. Original message: PermissionError(13, 'Um dispositivo conectado ao sistema no est funcionando.', None, 31)
Note: This error originates from pySerial. It is likely not a problem with esptool, but with the hardware connection or drivers.
